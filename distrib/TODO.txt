-----[ Latest Release ]-----
============================

Beta 0_57
8/23/2009
--new stuff
[X] Installs (and runs) in Vista as non-administrator


--fixes/other
[X] Better detection of Excel 2003 and ability to continue install with unknown versions
[X] Minor UI tweaks

=============================
-----[ Remaining TODOs ]-----
=============================

--functional
[ ] Easy way to find entries that are missing an attribute
[ ] Searching continues on if errors are encountered (?)
[ ] Add data to existing row option can now provide column headers
[ ] Improved UI
[ ] Ability to save queries
[ ] Fixed "Out of Memory" error
[ ] Redo intro video(s) with voice(?) and a faster pace


-- code
[ ] PUT THE VERSION REPORTING CODE BACK (I had to remove it because I lost the version.h file)
[ ] REFACTOR THIS MESS.  Pull things out into user classes or modules.  It's gettting too hard to location stuff in the source
[ ] Make searches more effient by:
	( ) Only requesting attributes that are required (right now ALL attributes are returned, but only certain ones are needed)
	( ) For treeview searches, only request the DN or something, we don't actually need any attributes other than the name
[ ] basedn picker allows ERROR: xxx messages to be selected and returned as the new basedn
[ ] Add an option for search results to appear with a single selected cell as the top/left corner
[ ] Provide a GUI to edit the config file
[ ] Detect multiple versions of Excel installed on the computer and remind user they can manually install to the other versions
[ ] Experiment with making tree browser item operations asynchronous - fire up a search thread that posts messages back
		as it find the items
[ ] get some sort of INI file missing error instead of trying to use default values if there's no INI file or it's invalid
		-I sorta did this by replacing the default values with an error messages, we'll see if this does anything useful
[ ] Open the tree view to the current basedn
[ ] Have option to save current basedn to the config file (maybe roll this in with the config file GUI idea)


-- install process
[ ] Automate the build steps (especially updating the version # in all the various locations)
[ ] Automate testing (maybe vs VPC A.D., local openLDAP, U of W public, and maybe the german server)
[ ] Handle the .ini file more gracefully during install - merge in new/changed items instead of just throwing away the existing file
[ ] Installer said it installed to Excel 2003 on laptop, where 2007 is installed...  Err, this seems to be because 2003 has taken over the .xls extension.  wtf?
[ ] If Excel isn't on the computer, the ELS installation dies horribly near the end and the installer leaves files and registry entries with no uninstaller.  But why are you trying to install this without Excel?
		
-- documentation/other
[ ] Add screenshots to sourceforge
[ ] Test on Windows Vista
[ ] Get an icon for the project
