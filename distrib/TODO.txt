Beta 0_54
4/3/2008
--new stuff
[X] Look at digitally signing the addin macro file (or find another way to avoid the "Enable Macros" annoyance)
[X] display version number and have it open a webpage that will display a message when there's a new version
 
--fixes
[X] doesn't display non-US characters correctly

==============================
-----[ Remaining TODOs ] -----
==============================

-- code
[ ] auto resize columns on search
[ ] basedn picker allowed ERROR: xxx messages to be selected and returned as the new basedn
[ ] Make searches more effient by:
	( ) Only requesting attributes that are required (right now ALL attributes are returned, but only certain ones are needed)
	( ) For treeview searches, only request the DN or something, we don't actually need any attributes other than the name
[ ] Add an option for search results to appear with a single selected cell as the top/left corner
[ ] Provide a GUI to edit the config file
[ ] Detect multiple versions of Excel installed on the computer and remind user they can manually install to the other versions
[ ] Experiment with making tree browser item operations asynchronous - fire up a search thread that posts messages back
		as it find the items
[ ] get some sort of INI file missing error instead of trying to use default values if there's no INI file or it's invalid
		-I sorted did this by replacing the default values with an error messages, we'll see if this does anything useful
[ ] Open the tree view to the current basedn
[ ] Have option to save current basedn to the config file (maybe roll this in with the config file GUI idea)
[ ] Detect if .ini file has been modified since last search and ask user to reload settings if it has
	
-- install process
[ ] Automate the build steps (especially updating the version # in all the various locations)

-- documentation/other
[ ] Add screenshots to sourceforge
[ ] Include version information in
	( ) excel source/form - maybe have a ?   about box thingy with a link to homepage
	(X) dll 
	(X) install scripts/installer exe
[ ] Test on Windows Vista
[ ] Get an icon for the project

Beta 0_53
3/07/2008
--fixes
[X] uninstaller deleted the DLL before unregistering it, leaving an orphaned (but harmless) registry entry
[X] port setting in the ldap_params.ini file was being ignored (the default 389 was being used)
[X] Search fails with "Operations Error" with Active Directory (tested with Windows 2003 server)
  (X) display appropriate error with invalid basedn (ie, Referral received = probably AD mismatched basedn)
[X] basedn picker doesn't work with AD - this is a bit ugly, but mostly seems to sort of work a little bit
