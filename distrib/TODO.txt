-----[ Latest Release ] -----
=============================

Beta 0_10
2/27/2008

All of the critical features are in place as of now, and I haven't run across any surprise bugs in a while.
Let's call this release a Beta release :)

--new stuff

[X] tree display for selecting basedn for searches
[X] Add a "Are you sure you want to overwrite everything? [ ] show this box again" popup to the overwriting search
[X] Open the GUI showing the last tab the user had open
[X] GPL License in all source files

--fixes
[X] FIX THE SVN LAYOUT so the stupid tags thing works properly
[X] Work around the "Compile error: Can't find project or library" error by handling unique attribute detection in the .dll

==============================
-----[ Remaining TODOs ] -----
==============================

-- code
[ ] Make searches more effient by:
	( ) Only requesting attributes that are required (right now ALL attributes are returned, but only certain ones are needed)
	( ) For treeview searches, only request the DN or something, we don't actually need any attributes other than the name
[ ] Add an option for search results to appear with a single selected cell as the top/left corner
[ ] Provide a GUI to edit the config file
[ ] Detect multiple versions of Excel installed on the computer and remind user they can manually install to the other versions
[ ] Simplify CCollection code by automatically setting the GetNextItem() iterator to 0 and doing away with GetFirstItem()
		Might have to add a resetCollection() method to manually set iterator back to 0 if someone wants to iterate a collection twice
[ ] Experiment with making tree browser item operations asynchronous - fire up a search thread that posts messages back
		as it find the items
[ ] get some sort of INI file missing error instead of trying to use default values if there's no INI file or it's invalid
		-I sorted did this by replacing the default values with an error messages, we'll see if this does anything useful
[ ] Tell user they need to close/open (or add a refresh button?) if they edit the config file
		
-- install process
[ ] Look at digitally signing the addin macro file (or find another way to avoid the "Enable Macros" annoyance)
[ ] Automate the build steps (especially updating the version # in all the various locations)
[ ] maybe install add-in in official location so it appears in the add-ins menu?

-- documentation/other
[ ] Add screenshots to sourceforge
[ ] Include version information in
	( ) excel source/form - maybe have a ?   about box thingy with a link to homepage
	(X) dll 
	(X) install scripts/installer exe
[ ] Test on Windows Vista
[ ] Get an icon for the project
